News: Redesign is in progress now.
Rasberry Pi will be on the top side, but flipped (top down).
STM32F0DISCOVERY will be on the buttom side.
This is because we can not route between the pinheaders
(that would be dangerous because of clearance...).

But as this will only be the first version to test everthing, it OK.

Next will be the testing and placing of the motor control circuit and the
routing of the sensor connectors.

# Info
This is the Eagle 6.x schematic/board for the main board.

When I'm working on the schematics I'll update the
'schematic.pdf', 'board.pdf' and 'board.png' files.
So you can watch the progress:

# Nice Pics (prototype)
This is the old prototype.
This is really ugly because I have to solder many parts on top side,
but on prototype i down have plated holes.
So every connector, via etc. is really ugly. But the point is to figure out
if its working, thats all. So don't blame me for this soldering :-)

# Order PCBs
For cheap PCBs you can order here:
http://www.elecrow.com/services-pcb-prototyping-c-73_116.html

Because most people will [have to] order 5 or 10 pieces you can ask
me if someone as some PCBs left. If you have PCBs left, please tell me via Github
or mail: mail at janhieber dot net

# Order parts
The parts are all from Reichelt (http://www.reichelt.de/) except the
STM32F0 CPU which I ordered on eBay.

Every part in the schematic has a attribute "R" with the Reichelt
part number as value.

To generate a BOM do the following:
 1. Open the schematic in Eagle
 2. File > Export > BOM    or    Datei > Exportieren > BOM
 3. I use "values" or "Werte" as list type.
 4. Maybe Reichelt accepts this list if you ask nice :)

If you are using Linux or Mac OSX you can use my order script, its called "orderBOM.sh"
in this folder.

Simply go into this folder with your terminal and execute it: ./orderBOM.sh
