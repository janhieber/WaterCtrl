# Raspberry Pi
This is for the Raspberry Pi only.

There will be an SDCard image and other things...

TODO:
The image should contain a Linux system, ready to run
with all stuff we need (control software, webinterface, database...).

The control algorithm and webinterface should be a copy of this git repo,
so we can easy update it.
